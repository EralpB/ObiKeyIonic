<ion-card-header>1) How can I use ObiKey?</ion-card-header>
<ion-card-content>Go on a website, click "Login with ObiKey", and scan the QR code with your phone. Then you will see what permissions the website wants to access and have the option to generate a random identity, or use one of your previous identities. If you approve, your data will be sent through a secure channel to your browser.</ion-card-content>
</ion-card>

<ion-card>
<ion-card-header>2) Which websites are supported?</ion-card-header>
<ion-card-content>You should either go to a website that supports ObiKey natively (they will let you know with a button, or a QR code), or download Google Chrome Plugin for ObiKey and use it in every website you visit.</ion-card-content>
</ion-card>

<ion-card>
<ion-card-header>3) What happens if I lose my phone?</ion-card-header>
<ion-card-content>Your data is gone forever, but you are safe if you encrypted it with a good password. We are working on backup features, we need to prioritize the requests, so let us know what you want.</ion-card-content>
</ion-card>

<ion-card>
<ion-card-header>4) Is it dangerous if someone scans my QR code?</ion-card-header>
<ion-card-content>No, the worst thing is that they could break your login process for that time, but they can't get your info in any way.</ion-card-content>
</ion-card>

<ion-card>
<ion-card-header>5) Which encryption are you using?</ion-card-header>
<ion-card-content>We are using AES encryption with 256-bit one-time keys. It will take around 300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000(10^56) years to crack this. Your local data is encrypted with your password, so if you put a password like 123123 brute-force will be much more easier, but that's only an issue if your phone gets physically stolen, online transactions are always secured with random 256-bit keys, even if you don't put a local password.</ion-card-content>
</ion-card>

<ion-card>
<ion-card-header>6) Can I use with mobile websites?</ion-card-header>
<ion-card-content>We support this kind of authorization, but developers need to implement this, it will take a bit time.</ion-card-content>
</ion-card>

<ion-card>
<ion-card-header>7) Can I use with applications?</ion-card-header>
<ion-card-content>We support this kind of authorization, but developers need to implement this, it will take a bit time.</ion-card-content>
</ion-card>

<ion-card>
<ion-card-header>8) Can I store my credit card info?</ion-card-header>
<ion-card-content>Very soon, depending on the feature requests we will prioritize what we must improve.</ion-card-content>
</ion-card>

<ion-card>
<ion-card-header>9) I heard you were open-source?</ion-card-header>
<ion-card-content>We are 100% open source, on will you can download all our code and build your own ObiKey server, also check if it suits your security standards.</ion-card-content>
